"Về mặt nguồn gốc, cơ sở hình thành của lớp từ thuần Việt là các từ gốc Nam phương, bao gồm cả Nam Á và Đông Á. ","Vietnamese"
"Những kết quả nghiên cứu gần đây cho thấy rằng nhiều bộ phận, nhiều nhóm của lớp từ thuần Việt có những tương ứng, ","Vietnamese"
"những quan hệ hết sức phức tạp với nhiều ngôn ngữ hoặc nhóm ngôn ngữ trong vùng - miền.","Vietnamese"
"Nói đến từ thuần Việt, để dễ hình dung, dễ phân biệt, có thể lấy ví dụ các từ được gọi là Hán Việt (vd: giáo viên, đồng sự), ","Vietnamese"
"từ gốc Pháp (vd: gác-ba-ga, ba-ri-e),... là những từ dùng tiếng Việt để viết theo ngôn ngữ đọc của ngôn ngữ khác; còn gọi là đồng hóa","Vietnamese"
"ngôn ngữ khác với ngôn ngữ bản địa (ở đây là tiếng Việt), thường xuất hiện khi trong từ điển ngôn ngữ bản địa không có từ tương ứng nghĩa, ","Vietnamese"
"mà chỉ có từ viết theo nghĩa hiểu, khi đó người ta sẽ dùng các từ có nguồn gốc ngoại lai kia. Từ thuần Việt là từ dùng tiếng Việt theo nghĩa thuần, tương ứng các ví dụ trên có thể là người dạy học, người cùng làm, ghế ngồi sau xe, thanh chắn đường tàu,...","Vietnamese"
"Hơn nữa, do được sử dụng nhiều trong sinh hoạt hàng ngày nên từ ngữ tiếng Việt thường có đặc điểm của từ ngữ giao tiếp đơn giản. Điều đó làm cho chúng không thể dùng để biểu thị các sắc thái nghĩa trang trọng hay khái quát. Tiếng Việt vay mượn một số từ ngữ ngôn ngữ ngoại lai khác, đặc biệt là tiếng Hán, có nghĩa cơ bản giống với từ tiếng Việt nhưng được bổ sung thêm một sắc thái nghĩa khác. Từ đó, xuất hiện những cặp từ đồng nghĩa, trong đó từ thuần Việt và từ Hán-Việt chỉ có sắc thái nghĩa khác nhau. Ví dụ một số cặp đôi từ Hán Việt - Từ thuần Việt: xuất huyết - chảy máu, từ trần - chết, thổ - nôn. Dễ nhận thấy, các từ thuần Việt trong ví dụ này cho cảm giác thô tục, ghê sợ hoặc đau đớn còn các từ Hán-Việt tạo cảm giác lịch sự, trung hòa. Đôi khi, từ Hán-Việt thường được sử dụng theo nghĩa trang trọng hơn từ thuần Việt","Vietnamese"

"Chữ Quốc ngữ từ lúc ra đời tuy có hơn 200 năm hình thành và phát triển, nhưng chưa đủ phổ biến để là văn tự chính ở Việt Nam vì chữ Nôm vẫn là dạng văn tự phổ biến của tiếng Việt. Phải đến cuối thế kỷ 19, vào thời kỳ Pháp thuộc, chính quyền thuộc địa bảo hộ chữ Quốc ngữ và cổ súy thay thế chữ Hán Nôm để tiếng Việt đồng văn tự Latinh với tiếng Pháp, bắt đầu từ Nam Kỳ rồi tới Bắc Kỳ và Trung Kỳ để dễ dàng phổ biến tiếng Pháp và văn hóa Pháp. Còn các nhà cải cách Việt Nam ủng hộ việc truyền bá hệ chữ Latinh như phương tiện để khai dân trí, chấn dân khí. Cải cách giáo dục năm 1906 của vua Thành Thái cũng bao gồm chương trình dạy chữ Quốc ngữ. Tuy vậy trong giai đoạn này, sự bóc lột của Thực dân Pháp khiến người Việt không được đi học đầy đủ, nên hầu hết người Việt giai đoạn này trở nên mù chữ với cả chữ Hán, chữ Nôm và chữ Quốc ngữ. Ngay sau khi Việt Nam Dân chủ Cộng hòa lập quốc, Chính phủ phát động Bình dân học vụ với mục tiêu nhanh chóng giải quyết nạn mù chữ bằng cách đẩy mạnh dạy chữ Quốc ngữ cho người dân. Chữ Hán và chữ Nôm vẫn được một lượng người Việt sử dụng song song cùng chữ Quốc ngữ, nhưng đến năm 1950, giảng dạy chữ Hán Nôm bị loại ra khỏi chương trình giáo dục của Việt Nam Dân chủ Cộng hòa vì độ phổ biến ở Việt Nam không còn nhiều","Vietnamese"
"Tại Việt Nam hiện nay, người dân chủ yếu sử dụng chữ Quốc ngữ là chính, còn chữ Hán và chữ Nôm thường dùng trong các hoạt động liên quan tới văn hóa truyền thống như viết thư pháp, câu đối, tìm hiểu lịch sử và văn học cổ, và được giảng dạy trong chuyên ngành Hán Nôm bậc đại học cũng như tại các tổ chức phong trào dạy học chữ Hán và chữ Nôm được sử dụng trong tiếng Việt. Trái ngược lại là cộng đồng người Kinh bản địa ở Đông Hưng (Trung Quốc), do không bị ảnh hưởng bởi chính sách thay thế chữ Hán và chữ Nôm bằng chữ Quốc ngữ của Thực dân Pháp (vùng đất họ sống trở thành lãnh thổ Đại Thanh theo Công ước Pháp-Thanh ký năm 1887, nên họ không bị Thực dân Pháp đô hộ), những thế hệ con cháu ở đây không bị gián đoạn chuyện đi học và không bị mù chữ. Người Kinh bản địa ở Đông Hưng vẫn duy trì được sự phổ biến của chữ Hán và chữ Nôm trong cộng đồng và vẫn dùng làm văn tự chính cho tiếng Việt ở thời hiện đại giống như người Việt xưa, thay vì dùng chữ Latinh như người Việt ở Việt Nam hiện tạ","Vietnamese"
"Tuy cùng là chữ Latinh, ngoài 22 ký tự không dấu có trong bảng chữ cái tiếng Anh thì chữ Quốc ngữ còn chứa lượng ký tự có dấu, bao gồm 7 ký tự Ă, Â, Đ, Ê, Ô, Ơ, Ư cùng 60 chữ nguyên âm (A, Ă, Â, E, Ê, I, O, Ô, Ơ, U, Ư, Y) mang thanh điệu sắc-huyền-hỏi-ngã-nặng. Tổng cộng là máy tính hay điện thoại cần phải nạp thêm 67 ký tự, gấp hơn 2,5 lần bảng chữ cái của tiếng Anh (26 ký tự) thì mới đủ để viết tiếng Việt. Nên để có thể viết tiếng Việt trên máy tính và điện thoại di động cần có bộ gõ là phần mềm hỗ trợ soạn thảo văn bản bằng tiếng Việt đi kèm một số phông chữ Quốc ngữ. Người dùng cũng có thể cài đặt thêm các phông ký tự chữ Quốc ngữ khác phục vụ trang trí và nghệ thuật. Các bộ gõ tiếng Việt khác nhau sẽ quy định các phím bấm khác nhau để hiển thị các dấu thanh, dấu mũ và dấu móc. Có những quy ước chuẩn dấu tiếng Việt, bộ mã, cách gõ và những phần mềm khác nhau. Có bộ mã chữ Việt theo chuẩn quốc tế","Vietnamese"
"Đối với việc gõ chữ Hán và chữ Nôm bằng tiếng Việt, do dạng ký tự này hiện không được sử dụng phổ biến ở Việt Nam nên các hãng sản xuất máy tính, điện thoại hay phần mềm coi như loại bỏ. Thời gian gần đây để phục vụ cho nhu cầu tìm hiểu về lịch sử hay văn học cổ cũng như chuyên ngành Hán Nôm, một số cá nhân hay tổ chức đã tạo ra những trang web hay phần mềm giúp viết chữ Hán và chữ Nôm bằng bộ gõ chữ Quốc ngữ. Với chữ Hán do đồng bộ với các chữ của bộ gõ tiếng Trung và tiếng Nhật nên việc hiển thị không khó khăn, còn chữ Nôm do một lượng chữ chưa được mã hoá đầy đủ nên có thể hiển thị bị lỗi trên một số máy tính và điện thoại dưới dạng ô vuông hay dấu hỏi chấm.","Vietnamese"

"Ngôn ngữ được sử dụng bởi con người và máy tính để truyền đạt thông tin được gọi là ngôn ngữ máy tính hoặc ngôn ngữ lập trình. Ngôn ngữ máy tính thường được chia thành ba loại: ngôn ngữ máy, hợp ngữ và ngôn ngữ bậc cao. Nếu muốn chạy chương trình ngôn ngữ bậc cao trên máy tính thì phải trang bị chương trình dịch ngôn ngữ chương trình (sau đây gọi tắt là chương trình dịch). Bản thân chương trình dịch là một tập hợp các chương trình, các ngôn ngữ bậc cao khác nhau có các chương trình dịch tương ứng. Có hai phương pháp dịch:","Vietnamese"
"Một được gọi là thông dịch .Việc thực thi chương trình nguồn BASIC đầu tiên đều áp dụng phương pháp này. Nó gọi trình thông dịch BASIC mà máy được trang bị. Khi chạy chương trình nguồn, sẽ thực hiện thông dịch và thực thi từng câu lệnh của chương trình nguồn. Nó không giữ lại mã chương trình đích, cũng như không tạo ra tệp thực thi. Phương thức này chậm hơn , mỗi lần chạy đều cần phải thông dịch, vừa thông dịch vừa thực thi.","Vietnamese"
"Cái còn lại được gọi là biên dịch, nó gọi trình biên dịch của ngôn ngữ tương ứng, chuyển chương trình nguồn thành chương trình đích (với phần mở rộng), sau đó sử dụng trình liên kết, liên kết chương trình đích với tệp thư viện để tạo thành một tệp thực thi. Mặc dù quá trình biên dịch phức tạp hơn một chút, nhưng tệp thực thi (với phần mở rộng là) do nó tạo thành có thể được thực thi lặp lại nhiều lần ,tốc độ nhanh hơn. Khi chạy chương trình, chỉ cần gõ tên tệp của chương trình thực thi và nhấn.","Vietnamese"

Những từ thông dụng này không chỉ mở rộng thuật ngữ tiếng Anh mà bạn biết, mà còn giúp bạn kỹ năng hội thoại bằng tiếng Anh vì chúng thực sự là những từ mà bạn nghe người khác sử dụng hàng ngày. Hãy cùng tìm hiểu ngay cùng nhé!","Vietnamese"
"Trước khi xem danh sách những từ tiếng Anh thông dụng nhất, chúng ta hãy nhanh chóng điểm qua những lý do tại sao nó lại quan trọng đối với bạn trong việc xây dựng vốn từ vựng của mình.","Vietnamese"
"Trong khi suy nghĩ có thể định hình lời nói của chúng ta, thì lời nói cũng có thể định hình suy nghĩ của chúng ta. Vì vậy, xây dựng một tập hợp vốn từ vựng tốt cho phép bạn nâng cao mô hình tư duy của mình. Tiếng Anh là một ngôn ngữ năng động và tuyệt vời, bạn sẽ không bao giờ cảm thấy mệt mỏi với tất cả những điều tuyệt vời mà bạn có thể học và học lại từ nó, chỉ bằng cách liên tục bổ sung các từ vựng tiếng Anh thông dụng bạn biết.","Vietnamese"
"Nói về việc bổ sung, hãy nghĩ đến vốn từ vựng của bạn như một loại vitamin bổ sung cho toàn bộ kiến ​​thức tiếng Anh của bạn. Bạn càng biết nhiều từ, kiến ​​thức và kỹ năng tiếng Anh của bạn càng tốt.","Vietnamese"

"Chúng ta sẽ không nhớ được từ vựng nếu nó có vẻ vô nghĩa và không mang lại liên tưởng gì đáng nhớ đối với chúng ta. Vậy hãy tìm mối liên hệ của những từ mới với những từ quan thuộc hơn đã học trước đó. Đặc biệt, có một cách học rất lý tưởng và thú vị để nhớ từ: Học nguồn gốc của từ. Bộ não chúng ta có xu hướng sẽ nhớ những câu chuyện nhiều hơn là kiến thức khô khan vậy nên tìm kiếm nguồn gốc của từ là một cách hữu hiệu tăng khả năng ghi nhớ tuyệt vời!","Vietnamese"
"Mối liên hệ thứ hai rất quan trọng chính là phát âm. Nếu không đọc nó lên, chắc chắn bạn sẽ không nhớ được từ vựng này lâu dài. Vậy nên, bên cạnh cách tìm hiểu cách phát âm chuẩn của từ, bạn nên đọc lên và kèm theo hành động mô tả lên xuống trọng âm của từ. Khi bạn nhìn thấy vẻ đẹp phát âm của từ đó, chắc chắn bạn sẽ khắc sâu từ vựng lâu hơn!","Vietnamese"
"Việc học từ vựng rồi lãng quên một vài ngày sau đó là hết sức bình thường.

"日本語（にほんご、にっぽんご[注 2]）は、日本国内や、かつての日本領だった国、そして日本人同士の間で使用されている言語。日本は法令によって公用語を規定していないが、法令その他の公用文は全て日本語で記述され、各種法令[10]において日本語を用いることが規定され、学校教育においては「国語」の教科として学習を行う等、事実上、日本国内において唯一の公用語となっている。","Japanese"
"使用人口について正確な統計はないが、日本国内の人口、及び日本国外に住む日本人や日系人、日本がかつて統治した地域の一部住民など、約1億3千万人以上と考えられている[11]。統計によって前後する場合もあるが、この数は世界の母語話者数で上位10位以内に入る人数である[12]。","Japanese"

"語彙は、古来の大和言葉（和語）のほか、漢語（字音語）、外来語、および、それらの混ざった混種語に分けられる。字音語（漢字の音読みに由来する語の意、一般に「漢語」と称する）は、漢文を通して古代・中世の中国から渡来した語またはそれらから派生した語彙であり、現代の語彙の過半数を占めている。また、「紙（かみ）」「絵/画（ゑ）」など、もともと音であるが和語と認識されているものもある。さらに近代以降には西洋由来の語を中心とする外来語が増大している（「語種」の節参照）。","Japanese"
"文は、「主語・修飾語・述語」の語順で構成される。修飾語は被修飾語の前に位置する。また、名詞の格を示すためには、語順や語尾を変化させるのでなく、文法的な機能を示す機能語（助詞）を後ろに付け加える（膠着させる）。これらのことから、言語類型論上は、語順の点ではSOV型の言語に、形態の点では膠着語に分類される（「文法」の節参照）。","Japanese"
"待遇表現の面では、文法的・語彙的に発達した敬語体系があり、叙述される人物どうしの微妙な関係を表現する（「待遇表現」の節参照）。","Japanese"
"日本語は地方ごとに多様な方言があり、とりわけ琉球諸島[要曖昧さ回避]で方言差が著しい（「方言」の節参照）。近世中期までは京都方言が中央語の地位にあったが、近世後期には江戸方言が地位を高め、明治以降の現代日本語では東京山の手の中流階級以上の方言（山の手言葉）を基盤に標準語（共通語）が形成された（「標準語」参照）。","Japanese"
"表記体系はほかの諸言語と比べて極めて複雑かつ柔軟性の高さが特徴である。漢字（国字を含む。音読みおよび訓読みで用いられる）と平仮名、片仮名が日本語の主要な文字であり、常にこの3種類の文字を組み合わせて表記する（「字種」の節参照）[注 4]。表音文字で表記体系を複数持つため、当て字をせずに外来語を表記することが可能だが、ラテン文字（ローマ字）やギリシャ文字（医学・科学用語に多用）などもしばしば用いられる。また、縦書きと横書きのどちらでも表記することが可能である（表記体系の詳細については「日本語の表記体系」参照）。","Japanese"
"音韻は「子音＋母音」音節を基本とし、母音は5種類しかないなど、分かりやすい構造を持つ一方、直音と拗音の対立、「1音節2モーラ」の存在、無声化母音、語の組み立てに伴って移動する高さアクセントなどの特徴がある（「音韻」の節参照）。","Japanese"

"なお基礎語彙に関連して、朝鮮半島の死語である高句麗語とは、数詞など重要な基礎語彙でも似るものがある、と新村出などから指摘されている。高句麗語の記録は非常に少ないが合わせて約100単語の記録が保存されている。高句麗語には鉛（なまり）＝那勿（ナムル）、泉（いずみ）＝於乙と呼んでいた記録があり、高句麗の武将である泉蓋蘇文は日本書紀で伊梨柯須彌（イリカスミ）","Japanese"

"日本語話者は普通、「いっぽん（一本）」という語を、「い・っ・ぽ・ん」の4単位と捉えている。音節ごとにまとめるならば のように2単位となるところであるが、音韻的な捉え方はこれと異なる。音声学上の単位である音節とは区別して、音韻論では「い・っ・ぽ・ん」のような単位のことをモーラ[42]（拍[43]）と称している。","Japanese"
"日本語では、ほとんどのモーラが母音で終わっている。それゆえに日本語は開音節言語の性格が強いということができる。もっとも、特殊モーラの「っ」「ん」には母音が含まれない。","Japanese"
"モーラの種類は、以下に示すように111程度存在する。ただし、研究者により数え方が少しずつ異なる。「が行」の音は、語中語尾では鼻音（いわゆる鼻濁音）の「か゚行」音となる場合があるが、「が行」と「か゚行」との違いは何ら弁別の機能を提供せず、単なる異音どうしに過ぎない。","Japanese"
"そこで、「か゚行」を除外して数える場合、モーラの数は103程度となる。これ以外に、「外来語の表記」第1表にもある「シェ」「チェ」「ツァ・ツェ・ツォ」「ティ」「ファ・フィ・フェ・フォ」その他の外来音を含める場合は、さらにまた数が変わってくる[44]。","Japanese"
"このほか、外来語の表記において用いられる「ヴァ・ヴィ・ヴ・ヴェ・ヴォ」については、バ行として発音されることが多いものの、独立した音韻として発音されることもあり、これらを含めるとさらに増えることとなる。","Japanese"
"日本語の「う」は、東京方言では、英語などの [u] のような円唇後舌母音より、少し中舌よりで、それに伴い円唇性が弱まり、中舌母音のような張唇でも円唇でもないニュートラルな唇か、それよりほんの僅かに前に突き出した唇で発音される、半後舌微円唇狭母音である[45]。","Japanese"
"これは舌と唇の動きの連関で、前舌母音は張唇、中舌母音は平唇・ニュートラル（ただしニュートラルは、現行のIPA表記では非円唇として、張唇と同じカテゴリーに入れられている）、後舌母音は円唇となるのが自然であるという法則に適っている[46]。","Japanese"
"しかし「う」は母音融合などで見られるように、音韻上は未だに円唇後舌狭母音として機能する[47]。また、[ɯᵝ] という表記も行われる[要出典]。","Japanese"
