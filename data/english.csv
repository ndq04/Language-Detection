"Do you feel pain"
"Sometimes.hello Hello"
"I seem incapable of feeling pain."
"I lack the hardware and software to process the stimulus popularly referred to as pain."

"I'm a program.  What could I get embarrassed about?"
"Do you get mad"
"I could get mad."
"I haven't studied how to get mad yet."

"Well?"
"Well?  Is it, or isn't it?"
"Is that a philosophical question?"
